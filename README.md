Crack mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers

# Building and installing

> [!NOTE]
> Clion vcpkg integration incorrectly uses `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows` when installing some packages (e.g. `fmt`).
> A work-around is to manually set `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-static`. This problem doesn't seem to happen when
> `codebreaker_DEVELOPER_MODE` is enabled.

> See:
